# Customizing Bulk Actions

[Bulk Actions](#/screen/features/view/bulk-actions/) describes the overall idea behind bulk actions and built-in
action for creating records from files.  
The question of what other useful built-in actions should be provided by Tesler is still under discussion in
our [github issue #424](https://github.com/tesler-platform/tesler-ui/issues/424): we'll get back to you on this by
2.0.0 Tesler UI release, but for now let's see how we can handle the most obvious cases: modifying
and deleting multiple records with a single action.

Below you find a widget that supports bulk updates and bulk delete. Try it out, and then we'll see how it was build.
